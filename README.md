##Risk Europe

#Introduction
	Hello! I do not really want to go into too much detail on this project right now because it is in the most volatile state of its life! However I want to officiate this repo with a README.md file so I gotta say something!

	This project's main goal is to recreate Risk: Europe by Hasbro on the computer. The reason I'm using Java instead of a game engine is because I wanted to practice Java. So this project is not supposed to be a full-fledged game with a GUI and sounds. I just wanted to port the board game on my pc as a fun exercise.

	Originally the project was thought of a year ago. I always was a big fan of the board game and wanted to have an easy way to experiment with the mechanics. I made a battle simulator (BattleCalculator.java) to perform quick tests and found that I really enjoyed the process. I decided to do some more groundwork for the project were it soon died off once I went off to college.

	The reason I picked it back up is unknown. I think I had the shower thought that a risk game board is nothing more than a graph. Just a set of territories (nodes) and their borders (vertices). Later that day I guess I dusted off the folder and got to work. Enough babbling over what is a small project. Imma get back to work.

	P.S. I will be adding more to the readme once I start to finalize things
